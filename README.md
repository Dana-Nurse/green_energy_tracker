# green_energy_tracker

**Introduction**

As an environmentalist, sustainability is close to my heart. I believe that we all have a responsibility to protect our planet for future generations. That's why I strive to live a sustainable lifestyle and promote eco-friendly practices whenever possible. Inspired by my passion for environmental conservation, I chose to base my project on the topic of green energy tracking.

**Project Overview**

The Green Energy Tracker is a database project designed to monitor and track renewable energy usage and production. It aims to provide insights into energy generation patterns, environmental impacts, and user interactions within the context of sustainable energy systems. By analysing data on energy sources, production levels, and environmental metrics, the project facilitates informed decision-making towards achieving sustainability goals.


**In this project, I have successfully implemented the following features:**

  - Join Views: Utilised various types of joins to create views that combine multiple tables in a logical manner.

  - Stored Function: Developed a stored function in the database that can be applied to queries.

  - Stored Procedure: Implemented a stored procedure in the database and demonstrated its functionality.

  - Trigger: Set up a trigger in the database and demonstrated how it operates.
  - Event: Created an event in the database and illustrated its execution.



**To get started with the Green Energy Tracker project, follow these steps:**

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the database schema using the provided SQL scripts.
3. Populate the tables with sample data to simulate energy tracking scenarios.
